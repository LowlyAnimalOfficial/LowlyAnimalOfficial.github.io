        <h2>About H.E.L.P</h2>
        <p>'Helping People Leave Peacefully' - H.E.L.P, is a program using AI, more precisely GPT 4. It's main first purpose is to intervene in an extreme situation. 
            Where you don't have access to anything else, but this app and its AI. The AI have been tested with emergency situation of many kinds. With real symptoms 
            to test how accurate is it's knowledge and the provided solutions. <br><br>Recently in the latest version, it can also simulate emergency situations, and 
            'act' as a human being having to go through them, in this scenario, you are a 911 operator and test your knowledge by providing the best help you can. <br>
            <br>Even tho I cannot promise that everything the AI provide is accurate, I can say that it tries to be as accurate as possible to real situations, and many 
            times proven right. There is many scenario/mode available, each using GPT 4 to focus on a specific subject to enchance its accuracy.
            <br><br>It also has an image generator, which for now doesn't do much but generating images you want. It is planned that the AI will be 
            able to generate an image made for guiding the user for specific situation.<br><br>For looking more friendly, it has a 'face', the AI can 
            show different emotions, some funny and some for more immersion. It can go from shocked to happy passing by feeling 'smart' and more, the AI also 
            blinks.<br><br>The import file functionality is here temporarly for importing text files in the case you need to past a longer paragraph. Because 
            of a problem where pasting a lot of text would just not work.</p>
